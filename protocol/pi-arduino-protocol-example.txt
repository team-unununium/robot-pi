// Arduino would send the data to the Pi every 500 milliseconds, otherwise nothing is sent
// Arduino -> Pi: Here is all the sensor's data
// "temp": A string of the temperature (encased by double quotes), round to 1 decimal place
// "humidity": A string of the humidity in percentage (encased by double quotes), round to 1 decimal place
// "frontObstacle": A string of the distance to the front obstacle (encased by double quotes) in mm, round to 1 decimal place, if there is no obstacle found use "-1.00"
// "backObstacle": A string of the distance to the back obstacle (encased by double quotes) in mm, round to 1 decimal place, if there is no obstacle found use "-1.00"
// "co": A string of the raw value of CO measured (encased by double quotes)
